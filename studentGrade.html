    /* Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

        Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 hence 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

                A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
